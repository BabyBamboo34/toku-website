## What I've Created

I generated one Ex Machina-style logo before hitting the image quota limit. Here's what you have:

### ✅ Generated
1. **Ex Machina-style wordmark** - Minimal serif typography with gradient

### 🔄 Image Generation Limit
I've exhausted the image generation quota (resets in ~5 hours), but I have a great solution...

## Option 1: Use the Generated Logo

The Ex Machina-style logo I created is now active on your site:
- File: `logo.png`
- Style: Minimal serif, elegant spacing
- Perfect for the sophisticated tech aesthetic

---

## Option 2: Pure CSS Text Logo (No Image Needed!)

For an even cleaner approach, I can replace the logo image with pure CSS typography that perfectly matches Ex Machina's style:

### CSS-Only Logo Concept
```
TOKU LABS
────────────
Engineered Workflows
```

**Benefits**:
- Loads instantly (no image)
- Perfectly crisp on all screens
- Easy to customize
- True to Ex Machina's typography-first approach

Would you like me to implement this pure CSS version? It would give you:
- Thin serif font (or clean geometric sans-serif)
- Perfect letter spacing
- Elegant gradient on text
- Optional thin line accent
- Ultra minimal, Ex Machina vibe

---

## Option 3: Wait for Image Generation Reset

In about 5 hours, I can generate:
- Additional variations of the Ex Machina-style logo
- Icon/mark versions
- Alternative typography treatments

## Typography Notes

If going the CSS route, here are font pairings that match Ex Machina's aesthetic:

**Serif Options** (elegant, refined):
- Cormorant Garamond
- Playfair Display
- Crimson Pro

**Sans-Serif Options** (minimal, clean):
- Work Sans (thin weight)
- Inter (light weight with wide spacing)
- Space Grotesk (current, but lighter weight)

The key is: **thin weight + wide letter-spacing + minimal decoration**
